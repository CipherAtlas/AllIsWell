# Icon Requirements Summary

## ✅ You Have
- `AllisWell.ico` - Favicon for browser tabs (working!)

## ⚠️ You Need to Add

### Required for PWA (Progressive Web App)
1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

**Location:** Place both files in the `public/` folder

**Why:** These are used when users "Add to Home Screen" on mobile devices

## How to Create Them

### If you have the original design/PNG:
1. Open in any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.NET, etc.)
2. Resize to 192x192 → Save as `icon-192.png`
3. Resize to 512x512 → Save as `icon-512.png`
4. Place both in `public/` folder

### If you only have the .ico file:
1. Convert .ico to PNG using: https://convertio.co/ico-png/
2. Resize the PNG to 192x192 and 512x512
3. Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
4. Place both in `public/` folder

## Quick Test

After adding the icons, check:
1. Open the app in browser
2. Check browser tab - should show your favicon ✅
3. On mobile, try "Add to Home Screen" - should show your icon

## Android Icons

Android app icons are auto-generated by Capacitor. If you want custom ones later:
- Use Android Studio's Image Asset Studio
- Or manually replace files in `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/`
