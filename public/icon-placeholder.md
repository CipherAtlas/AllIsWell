# App Icons

For PWA functionality, you'll need to create two icon files:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

You can:
1. Create simple icons using any image editor
2. Use an online icon generator
3. Use a placeholder service like: https://via.placeholder.com/192 or https://via.placeholder.com/512

The icons are referenced in `manifest.json` for the PWA installation.

For now, the app will work without icons, but users won't be able to install it as a PWA.
